**Diamond Market Price Prediction Project**

**Overview**

Welcome to the Diamond Market Price Prediction Project! 
This repository showcases a machine learning project focused on predicting diamond prices based on their attributes.
This project aims to provide valuable insights for jewelers, appraisers, and consumers, helping them understand the factors that influence diamond pricing and make informed decisions in the market.

**Project Highlights**

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Performed an in-depth analysis to uncover trends and patterns in diamond characteristics such as carat, cut, color, and clarity.
* **Feature Engineering**: Created new features and refined existing ones to improve the accuracy and robustness of the prediction model.
* **Modeling**: Experimented with various machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, catboost regressor and Gradient Boosting, to predict diamond prices accurately.
* **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared to ensure reliable predictions.
* **Insights**: Provided insights into the most influential factors affecting diamond prices, helping stakeholders understand the value determinants.
* **Model Deployment**: The model was deployed into a web application for usage.

**Dataset**

The dataset consists of comprehensive information on diamonds, including their physical attributes and quality ratings.
This data serves as the foundation for building predictive models and understanding market trends.

**Usage**

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to real-world data, offering a framework for predictive analysis in the gemstone industry.
Users can adapt the methodology and insights for similar applications in other markets.

**Results**

The project identified carat weight, clarity, and cut quality as primary predictors of diamond prices. 
The final model achieved a high R-squared value, indicating strong predictive capability and providing valuable insights for pricing strategies.
The model was further deployed into a web app to allow user access.
